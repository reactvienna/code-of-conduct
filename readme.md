# ReactVienna Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

This code of conduct applies to all ReactVienna-sponsored spaces, including our meetups, parties, forums and other spaces that ReactVienna hosts, both online and offline.

Some of these spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

## Need Help?

Contact one of the meetup organisers immediately:

- **Max Stoiber (contact@mxstbr.com)**
- Nik Graf (nik@nikgraf.com)
- Andrey Okonetchnikov (andrey@okonet.ru)
- Glenn Reyes (glenn@glennreyes.com)
- Karl Horky (karl.horky@gmail.com)
- Patrick Stapfer (p.stapfer@gmail.com)
- Ram√≥n Huidobro (hola@ramonh.dev)

There'll always be at least one of them at any ReactVienna-sponsored space.

There is also a **point of contact outside of the organiser group** in case you don't feel comfortable reaching out to them: Laura Gaetano, who works at TravisCI and organises the Rails Girls Summer of Code. (laura@travis-ci.org)

## The Quick Version

Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at the discretion of the organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the meetup organisers immediately via the contact details provided above.

The organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.
